## Version support

Coming Soon

### Supported versions

Almost all versions (and snapshots!) between 1.7 and the latest one (1.19.3 as of writing this) are supported.  
I plan to maintain Minosoft to at least version 1.20, so stay tuned, also support for older protocols will not be dropped as newer protocols are added. It is still recommended using the latest stable version.  
See [Version support](/doc/VersionSupport.md) for more details.

## Modding

Works, still missing some features to make modding super easy (see e.g. [#12](https://gitlab.bixilon.de/bixilon/minosoft/-/issues/12))
